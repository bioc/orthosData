# orthosData

`orthosData` is an
R/[ExperimentHub](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ExperimentHub.html)
package providing access to data objects required for the methods implemented 
in the [orthos](https://github.com/fmicompbio/orthos) package for mechanistic studies using differential gene expression experiments.

It currently encompasses data for over 100,000 differential gene expression mouse and human experiments distilled and compiled from the ARCHS4 database[*](*) as well as associated pre-trained variational models.

Together with `orthos` it was developed  to provide a better understanding of the effects of experimental treatments on gene expression and to help map treatments to mechanisms of action.


The data are hosted on [Zenodo, doi:10.5281/zenodo.7908269](https://zenodo.org/record/7908269/).
